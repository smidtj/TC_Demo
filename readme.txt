TouchCommerce Demo
Author: Jesse Smidt

Purpose:
To demonstrate competency with modern web frameworks as would be used while employed by TouchCommerce.

Organization:
E1 contains Exercise 1 and E2 contains Exercise 2.

Known Issues:
  -  Coloration. Some colors may be very slightly off.
  -  Red "!" triangles. No image file was included in the assets to create this effect.
  -  Unused .pngs. "btn-send-hover.png" and "btn-send-idle.png" were not utilized as their purpose was unclear (they're small vertical green lines).
  -  "Start Chat" button.  This button is not quite right (css-wise).

Note:
Application was developed and tested with chrome. Application has only been tested offline and has not been hosted.
